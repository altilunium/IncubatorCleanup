This is the testcases file where you can check if the replacements are done probably. It should warn you about remaining prefixes on lines 11, 14 and 16.

'''This''' is some wiki syntax where we have a [[Wp/ru/Link|link]] to a page. Some times we will have a  {{wp/ru/red text|template that should give red text}} or something.

This should give a [[Wp/ru/Link|linktrail]]. Bonus: You could check if the $linkTrail setting in MessagesXxx.php has correct settings. You  might want to add (or request that someone adds) special characters in this language to its regex.

This one, however, should ''not'' give a [[Wp/ru/liNk|linktrail]].

Some times editors use [[ Wp/ru/spaces in weird places    | when they edit ]], but that should still work with the script, since it's still valid wikicode.

This line (line 11) should make the script give a warning, since Wp/ru is present in the line and won't be replaced. However, since the prefix was visible while the revision was on the Incubator, it should also still be present in the import even if it is in error.

The link in [[Wp/ru/This line|this line]] should not be piped in the output file.
However, if the editor wrote [[ wp/ruThis instead|This instead]], the prefix will remain. This line (line 14) will also give a warning when the script is run.

If for some reason the editors have put capital letters where there shouldn't be, those cases '''will not''' be removed by the script. [[WP/ru/All|All]] [[WP/RU/of these|of these]] [[Wp/Ru/Links|links]] will remain as they are, but the script will give a warning about this line (line 16).

At the end of the page (or wherever, really) you will have some categories. Here the category in the middle should be removed, while the others should have their prefixes removed. If you specify the --translatens parameter, these would be localized with the correct category names for Russian.

[[Category:Wp/ru/Test cases| ]]
[[ Category:Wp/ru|Sort key]]
[[  Category : Wp/ru/Jokes   ]]

Some times people will put all categories in one line, but the same should be the result then:
[[Category:Wp/ru/Test cases| ]][[Category : Wp/ru]][[Category:wp/ru/jokes]]

If you specify the --translatens parameter, the namespaces here should all be translated into Russian:
[[Talk:Wp/ru/Something]]
[[File:Flag of Tanzania.svg|thumb|120px|Flag of Tanzania]]
[[Image:Flag of Norway.svg|thumb|120px|Flag of Norway]]
[[User:Someusername]]
[[User talk:Some other username]]
[[Template:This is a template]]
[[Template talk:Tak page]]
[[Help:A help page]]
[[Help talk:A help talk page]]
